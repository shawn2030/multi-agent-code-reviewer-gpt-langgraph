        "- **Efficiency and Performance:** Is the revised code reasonably efficient? (Note: This might be harder to judge without running benchmarks, but look for obvious inefficiencies).\n",

        "\n",
        "1.  **Preparation:**\n",
        "    *   Compile the set of test cases (original code, task description, user prompt).\n",
        "    *   Run each agent against each test case to generate responses (code review, revised code).\n",
        "    *   Structure the data for presentation: For each test case, group the original materials and the responses from all agents being evaluated for that test case.\n",
        "    *   Ensure automated metrics (like PEP 8 reports, execution results) are available alongside the agent responses, but clearly separated so evaluators focus on subjective aspects.\n",
        "    *   Prepare the human evaluation rubric and guidelines document.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Platform/Method for Evaluation:**\n",
        "    *   **Option A (Simple):** Use a shared document (e.g., Google Doc, Word document) where each test case and agent response is presented, followed by the rubric table for scoring and comment sections. Evaluators fill out the document directly.\n",
        "    *   **Option B (Intermediate):** Create a simple web form using tools like Google Forms, SurveyMonkey, or a custom-built form. The form would present the test case details, agent responses, and then ask for scores and comments based on the rubric.\n",
        "    *   **Option C (Advanced):** Utilize a dedicated evaluation platform or build a custom internal tool that presents the information in a structured way, manages evaluators, and handles data collection.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Evaluator Training/Onboarding:**\n",
        "    *   Share the human evaluation guidelines and rubric with the evaluators.\n",
        "    *   Provide a brief training session or clear instructions on how to use the chosen evaluation platform/document and what is expected of them.\n",
        "    *   Consider a pilot evaluation with a few test cases to ensure evaluators understand the process and rubric.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Execution:**\n",
        "    *   Assign test cases to evaluators. Each test case might be evaluated by multiple human evaluators to ensure reliability and capture diverse perspectives.\n",
        "    *   Evaluators review the materials and fill out the rubric/form for each agent response.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  **Data Collection:**\n",
        "    *   If using shared documents, consolidate the scores and comments manually or with scripts.\n",
        "    *   If using a web form or platform, the data is automatically collected in a database or spreadsheet.\n",

Scores and comments will be extracted and compiled into a structured format, likely a spreadsheet (e.g., CSV, Excel) or a pandas DataFrame. This process is more labor-intensive and prone to errors but is simple to set up.\n",

This could be a database (e.g., SQL, NoSQL) or exported into a structured file format (e.g., CSV, JSON) for analysis. This method is more efficient and less error-prone for collection.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Storage Format:**\n",
        "Regardless of the collection method, the data should be stored in a structured format that allows for easy analysis. A tabular format is recommended, where each row represents a single human evaluation score/comment for a specific criterion, agent, and test case. Key columns should include:\n",

        "*   `comments`: Any qualitative comments provided by the evaluator.\n",
        "*   `timestamp`: When the evaluation was recorded.\n",
        "\n",
        "This structured format will facilitate analysis, allowing us to calculate average scores per criterion, per agent, and per test case, and to correlate human evaluations with automated metrics. The data will be stored in a secure location, accessible for the analysis phase.\n",

            "    *   Run each agent against each test case to generate responses (code review, revised code).\n",

            "    *   **Option B (Intermediate):** Create a simple web form using tools like Google Forms, SurveyMonkey, or a custom-built form. The form would present the test case details, agent responses, and then ask for scores and comments based on the rubric.\n",
            "    *   **Option C (Advanced):** Utilize a dedicated evaluation platform or build a custom internal tool that presents the information in a structured way, manages evaluators, and handles data collection.\n",

The next steps are to correlate the automated metrics with human evaluations (Instruction 5), synthesize the findings (Instruction 6), and present the analysis (Instruction 7). Since I only have data for one agent and one test case, and the automated metrics summary indicated \"No automated metrics data available\" (because `evaluation_results` was likely reset or not populated correctly in the environment), I cannot perform a meaningful correlation or a comprehensive synthesis across multiple agents/test cases. However, I can still outline how these steps would be done and present the available data. I will present the available human evaluation statistics and the (empty) automated metrics summary as the current analysis result.

These cases span various programming concepts like factorial calculation, CSV processing, sorting, web scraping, and object-oriented programming.\n",
        "*   Automated metrics functions were successfully implemented: `check_pep8_compliance` using `flake8` to measure code style adherence and `execute_code` to run code strings and capture output/errors, enabling objective checks on code quality and correctness.\n",
        "*   A structured human evaluation process was designed, including a detailed 1-5 scale rubric based on the defined criteria, comprehensive guidelines for human evaluators, an outline for the evaluation process (covering preparation, platform options, training, and execution), and a description of the data collection and storage method.\n",
        "*   Analysis of dummy human evaluation data revealed potential strengths in \"Helpfulness of Explanations\" and \"Overall Helpfulness\" (average 4.5) and \"Correctness and Functionality\" (average 4.5).\n",
        "*   Analysis of dummy human evaluation data indicated potential weaknesses or areas for improvement in \"Efficiency and Performance\" (average 3.0) and variability in scores for \"Accuracy of Review Findings,\" \"Comprehensiveness of Review,\" \"Code Style and Readability,\" and \"Security Considerations.\"\n",
        "*   Qualitative comments from dummy data suggested minor code issues and style as specific areas needing attention.\n",
        "*   The analysis process highlighted the importance of automated metrics, as their absence prevented a full correlation analysis with human evaluations.\n",

        "*   Implement the proposed improvements, focusing on refining agent prompts to explicitly emphasize PEP 8 compliance and list specific areas for comprehensive code review (error handling, efficiency, security). Integrate an automated code execution check into the workflow.\n",
        "*   Conduct a full re-evaluation using the improved agents, comprehensive test cases, and both automated metrics and blinded human evaluations to objectively measure the impact of the changes and identify further areas for iteration.\n"
