# multi-agent-code-reviewer-gpt-langgraph
This project implements a **multi-agent system** for automated code review using **LangGraph**, **LangChain**, and **GPT models**.   It simulates a collaborative workflow between multiple agents (Reviewer, Coder, Result Handler) to analyze, improve, and finalize code quality iteratively.
